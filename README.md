# LiquidityPool_Contracts

### TODO
Add approve() on staking for security
Add interest on stake
Make it behave like a market (random maybe?)
    Change event parameters
    Change Balances withdrawn

Note for dApp, might need to make error events if you want the UI to update with errors.
Regular errors from a require are not logged to the blockchain.
