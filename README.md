# LiquidityPool_Contracts
Set of contracts to mimic Liquidity Pool functionality.  
Two ERC20 standard token contracts are created which are then used to drive the liquidity pool economy.

## Compilation + Deployment Notes
To interact with contracts, use the preferred Ethereum Smart Contract software.  
Ensure you compile and deploy token contracts (TokenA, TokenB) before the liquidity pool contract.

## Current TODO
Add approve() on staking for security  
Add Error events for error feedback on the Dapp client  
Add interest on stake  
Market behavior for tokens
